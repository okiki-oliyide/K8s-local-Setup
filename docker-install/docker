On CentOS 7, you can install Docker from the official Docker repository.

1. Add the Docker repository to your system:

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

2. Install the latest version of Docker CE, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

sudo yum install docker-ce

3. Start Docker:

sudo systemctl start docker

4. Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the hello-world image:

sudo docker run hello-world

If the command returns a “Hello from Docker” message, then Docker is successfully installed.
